## Starting a chain

### `chainFrom(iterable)`

Starts a chain. Any number of transformation methods may be added, after which a
termination method should be called to produce a result. No computation is done
until a termination method is called.

The argument may be any iterable, including an array or a string. This is back
compatible with older browsers which did not implement the `Iterable` interface.

### `transducerBuilder()`

Starts a chain for constructing a new transducer. Any number of trasformation
methods may be added, after which `.build()` should be called to produce a
transducer.

## Transformation methods

Any number of these methods may be called on a chain to add transformations in
sequence.

### `.dedupe()`

Removes elements that are equal to the proceeding element (using `===` for
equality). For example:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3])
    .dedupe()
    .toArray(); // -> [1, 2, 3]
```

### `.drop(n)`

Skips the first `n` elements. If there are fewer than `n` elements, then skip
all of them. If `n` is negative, then leave the elements unchanged (same as
`0`).

For example:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .drop(3)
    .toArray(); // -> [4, 5]
```

### `.dropWhile(pred)`

Skips elements as long as the predicate `pred` holds. For example:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .dropWhile(n => n < 3)
    .toArray(); // -> [3, 4, 5]
```

### `.filter(pred)`

Keeps only the elements matching the predicate `pred`. For example:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4])
    .map(x => x % 2 === 1)
    .toArray(); // -> [1, 3]
```

### `.flatMap(f)`

For `f` a function which maps each element to an iterable, applies `f` to each
element and concatenates the results. For example:

```ts
const authors = [
    { name: "cbrontÃ«", books: ["Jane Eyre", "Shirley"] },
    { name: "mshelley", books: ["Frankenstein"] },
];

chainFrom(authors)
    .flatMap(author => author.books)
    .toArray();
// -> ["Jane Eyre", "Shirley", "Frankenstein"]
```

### `.interpose(separator)`

Inserts `separator` between each pair of elements. For example:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .interpose(0)
    .toArray();
// -> [1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 5]
```

### `.map(f)`

Transforms each element by applying `f` to it. For example:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 3])
    .map(x => x * 2)
    .toArray(); // -> [2, 4, 6]
```

### `.mapIndexed(f, i)`

Transforms each element by applying `f` to the element and the current index in the sequence. For example:

```ts
chainFrom(["a", "b", "c"])
    .mapIndexed((x, i) => [x, i])
    .toArray(); // -> [["a", 0], ["b", 1], ["c", 2]]
```

### `.partitionAll(n)`

Groups elements into arrays of `n` elements. If the number of elements does not
divide perfectly by `n`, the last array will have fewer than `n` elements.
Throws if `n` is nonpositive. For example:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .partitionAll(2)
    .toArray();
// -> [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]
```

### `.partitionBy(f)`

Groups consecutive elements for which `f` returns the same value (as determined
by `===`) into arrays. For example:

```ts
chainFrom(["a", "ab", "bc", "c", "cd", "cde"])
    .partitionBy(s => s[0])
    .toArray();
// -> [["a", "ab"], ["bc"], ["c", "cd", "cde"]]
```

### `.remove(pred)`

Like `filter()`, but removes the elements matching `pred` instead. For example:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 3])
    .remove(x => x % 2 === 1)
    .toArray(); // -> [2, 4]
```

### `.removeAbsent()`

Removes `null` and `undefined` elements (but not other falsy values). For
example:

```ts
chainFrom([0, 1, null, 2, undefined, 3])
    .removeAbsent()
    .toArray(); // -> [0, 1, 2, 3]
```

### `.take(n)`

Takes the first `n` elements and drops the rest. An essential opperation for
efficiency, because it stops computations from occurring on more elements of the
input than needed to produce `n` results. If there are less than `n` elements,
then leave all of them unchanged. If `n` is negative, then take none of them
(same as `0`). For example:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .take(3)
    .toArray(); // -> [1, 2, 3]
```

### `.takeNth(n)`

Takes every `n`th element, starting from the first one. In other words, it takes
the elements whose indices are multiples of `n`. Throws if `n` is nonpositive.
For example:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    .takeNth(2)
    .toArray(); // [1, 3, 5]
```

### `.takeWhile(pred)`

Takes elements as long as the predicate `pred` holds, then drops the rest. Like
`take()`, stops unnecessary computations on elements after `pred` fails. For
example:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .takeWhile(n => n < 3)
    .toArray(); // -> [1, 2]
```

### `.compose(transducer)`

Add an arbitrary transducer to the chain. `transducer` should be a function
which implements the [transducer
protocol](https://githube.com/cognitect-labs/transducers-js#the-transducer-protocol),
meaning it is a function which takes a `Transformer` and returns another
`Transformer`. This is the most general transformation, and it is used by this
library internally to implement all the others. For example usage, see the
[Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage) section.

## Ending a chain

The following methods terminate a chain started with `chainFrom`, performing the
calculations and producing a result.

### `.count()`

Returns the number of elements. For example:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .filter(x => x % 2 === 1)
    .count(); // -> 3
```

### `.every(pred)`

Returns `true` if all elements satisfy the predicate `pred`, or `false`
otherwise. Short-circuits computation once a failure is found. Note that this is
equivalent to `.remove(pred).isEmpty()`.

Example:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .map(n => 10 * n)
    .every(n => n > 3); // -> true

chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .map(n => 10 * n)
    .every(n => n < 30); // -> false
```

### `.find(pred)`

Returns the first element of the result which satisfies the predicate `pred`, or
`null` if no such element exists. Note that this is equivalent to
`.filter(pred).first()`.

Example:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .map(x => x * 10)
    .find(x => x % 6 === 0); // -> 30
```

### `.first()`

Returns the first element of the result, or `null` if there are no other
elements. Short-circuits computation, so no more work is done than necessary to
get the first element.

Example:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .map(x => x * 10)
    .first(); // -> 10
```

### `.forEach(f)`

Calls `f` on each element of the result, presumably for side-effects. For
example:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .map(x => x * 10)
    .forEach(x => console.log(x));
// Prints 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
```

### `.isEmpty()`

Returns `true` if there are any elements, else `false`. For example:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .filter(n => n > 10)
    .isEmpty(); // -> true

chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .filter(n => n % 2 === 0)
    .isEmpty(); // -> false
```

### `.joinToString(separator)`

Returns a string obtained by concatenating the elements together as strings with
the separator between them. For example:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .filter(n => n % 2 === 1)
    .joinToString(" -> "); // -> "1 -> 3 -> 5"
```

Not called `toString()` in order to avoid clashing with the `Object` prototype
method.

### `.some(pred)`

Returns `true` if any element satisfies the predicate `pred`, or `false`
otherwise. Short-circuits computation once a match is found. Note that this is
equivalent to `.filter(pred).isEmpty() === false`.

Example:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .map(n => 10 * n)
    .some(n => n === 30); // -> true

chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .map(n => 10 * n)
    .some(n => n === 1); // -> false
```

### `.toArray()`

Returns an array of the results. See any of the above examples.

### `.toMap(getKey, getValue)`

Returns an ES6 `Map`, each of whose key-value pairs is generated by calling the
provided funtions on each element in the result. If multiple elements produce
the same key, then the value produced by the latest element will override the
earlier ones. Similar to [`.toObject()`](#toobjectgetkey-getvalue), except that the
`getKey` function is permitted to return any type of value, not just a string.

This function assumes that `Map` is present in your environment. **If you call
this function, you are responsible for providing a polyfill if your environment
does not natively support `Map`.**

Example:

```ts
const authors = [
    { name: "cbrontÃ«", books: ["Jane Eyre", "Shirley"] },
    { name: "mshelley", books: ["Frankenstein"] },
];

chainFrom(authors).toMap(a => a.id, a => a.books.length);
// -> Map{ "cbrontÃ«" -> 2, "mshelley" -> 4 }
```

### `.toMapGroupBy(getKey, transformer?)`

Produces an ES6 `Map` by grouping together all elements for which `getKey`
returns the same value under that key. By default, each key corresponds to an
array of the elements which produced that key.

Optionally, a transformer may be passed as the second argument to configure the
reduction behavior of the values. All chain-ending methods in this section other
than `.toIterator()` have a standalone variant which produces a transformer (for
details, see the section [Tree-shakeable API](#tree-shakeable-api)), which opens
many possibilities. Some advanced examples are shown below.

Similar to [`.toObjectGroupBy()`](#toobjectgroupbygetkey-transformer), except
that the `getKey` function is permitted to return any type of value, not just a
string.

This function assumes that `Map` is present in your environment. **If you call
this function, you are responsible for providing a polyfill if your environment
does not natively support `Map`.**

Examples:

```ts
chainFrom(["a", "b", "aa", "aaa", "bc"])
    .toMapGroupBy(s => s[0]);
// -> Map{ "a" -> ["a", "aa", "aaa"], "b" -> ["b", "bc"] }

chainFrom(["a", "b", "aa", "aaa", "bc"])
    .toMapGroupBy(s => s[0], count());
// -> Map{ "a" -> 3, "b" -> 2 }

chainFrom(["a", "b", "aa", "aaa", "bc"])
    .toMapGroupBy(s => s[0], some(s => s.length === 3));
// -> Map{ "a" -> true, "b" -> false }

chainFrom(["a", "b", "aa", "aaa", "bc"])
    .toMapGroupBy(s => s[0], map((s: string) => s.length)(toAverage()));
// -> Map{ "a" -> 2, "b" -> 1.5 }
```

### `.toObject(getKey, getValue)`

Returns an object, each of whose key-value pairs is generated by calling the
provided functions on each element in the result. If multiple elements produce
the same key, then the value produced by the latest element will override the
earlier ones. Similar to [`.toMap()`](#tomapgetkey-getvalue), except that the
`getKey` function is required to return a string.

Example:

```ts
const authors = [
    { name: "cbrontÃ«", books: ["Jane Eyre", "Shirley"] },
    { name: "mshelley", books: ["Frankenstein"] },
];

chainFrom(authors).toObject(a => a.id, a => a.books.length);
// -> { cbrontÃ«: 2, mshelley: 1 }
```

### `.toObjectGroupBy(getKey, transformer?)`

Produces an object by grouping together all elements for which `getKey` returns
the same value under that key. By default, each key corresponds to an array of
the elements which produced that key.

Optionally, a transformer may be passed as the second argument to configure the
reduction behavior of the values. All chain-ending methods in this section other
than `.toIterator()` have a standalone variant which produces a transformer (for
details, see the section [Tree-shakeable API](#tree-shakeable-api)), which opens
many possibilities. Some advanced examples are shown below.

Similar to [`.toMapGroupBy()`](#tomapgroupbygetkey-transformer), except
that the `getKey` function required to return a string.

Examples:

```ts
chainFrom(["a", "b", "aa", "aaa", "bc"])
    .toObjectGroupBy(s => s[0]);
// -> { a: ["a", "aa", "aaa"], b: ["b", "bc"] }

chainFrom(["a", "b", "aa", "aaa", "bc"])
    .toObjectGroupBy(s => s[0], count());
// -> { a: 3, b: 2 }

chainFrom(["a", "b", "aa", "aaa", "bc"])
    .toObjectGroupBy(s => s[0], some(s => s.length === 3));
// -> { a: true, b: false }

chainFrom(["a", "b", "aa", "aaa", "bc"])
    .toMapGroupBy(s => s[0], map((s: string) => s.length)(toAverage()));
// -> { a: 2, b: 1.5 }
```

### `.toSet()`

Returns an ES6 `Set` of the results.

This function assumes that `Set` is present in your environment. **If you call
this function, you are responsible for providing a polyfill if your environment
does not natively support `Set`.**

### `.toIterator()`

Returns an iterator. Elements of the input iterator are not read until this
iterator is read, and then only as many as needed to compute the number of
results requested. This is the primary way of reading results lazily.

Example:

```ts
const iterator = chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .map(x => x * 10)
    .toIterator();
console.log(iterator.next().value()); // Prints 10
// So far, the map function has only been called once.
```

### `.reduce(reducer, intialValue?)`

Reduces the elements according to the reducer, and returns the result. `reducer`
may be either a plain function of the form `(acc, x) => acc` or a transformer as
defined by the [transformer
protocol](https://github.com/cognitect-labs/transducers-js#transformer-protocol).
This is the most general way to terminate a chain, and all the others (except
for `toIterator`) are implemented using it.

Example of using a plain function reducer:

```ts
chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .map(x => x * 10)
    .reduce((acc, x) => acc + x, 0); // -> 150
```

A handful of pre-made transformers are provided by this library to be used with
`reduce()`. They are described in the next section.

## Reducers

These APIs provide objects which may be passed to `reduce()`, as described in
the previous section, to provide additional options for completing chains whose
elements are of specific types- for example, `toSum()` can only be used on a
chain of numbers.

They are kept as separate transformer objects, rather than added as additional
termination methods, to maintain type safety in TypeScript projects. TypeScript
does not provide a way to restrict which of an interface's methods may be called
depending on the value of a type parameter, so adding these as termination
methods would mean they could be called regardless of the current element type.
By contrast, passing one of these reducers to `reduce()` on a chain of the
incorrect type will be caught as an error by TypeScript.

### `toSum()`

For a chain of numbers, return their sum. If the input is empty, return `0`. For
example:

```ts
chainFrom(["a", "bb", "ccc"])
    .map(s => s.length)
    .reduce(toSum()); // -> 6
```

### `toAverage()`

For a chain of numbers, return their average, or `null` if there are no
elements. For example:

```ts
chainFrom(["a", "bb", "ccc"])
    .map(s => s.length)
    .reduce(toAverage()); // -> 2
```

### `toMin(comparator?)`

Returns the minimum element, according to the comparator. If no comparator is
provided, then this reducer may only be applied if the elements are numbers and
uses the natural comparator. Returns `null` if there are no elements.

Example:

```ts
chainFrom(["a", "bb", "ccc"])
    .map(s => s.length)
    .reduce(toMin()); // -> 1
```

### `toMax(comparator?)`

Returns the maximum element, according to the comparator. If no comparator is
provided, then this reducer may only be applied if the elements are numbers and
uses the natural comparator. Returns `null` if there are no elements.

Example:

```ts
chainFrom(["a", "bb", "ccc"])
    .map(s => s.length)
    .reduce(toMax()); // -> 3
```

## Utility functions

### `isReduced(result)`

Returns true if `result` is a reduced value as described by the [transducer
protocol](https://github.com/cognitect-labs/transducers-js#reduced).

### `rangeIterator(start?, end, step?)`

Returns an iterator which outputs values from `start` inclusive to `end`
exclusive, incrementing by `step` each time. `start` and `step` may be omitted,
and default to `0` and `1` respectively.

If step is positive, then outputs values incrementing upwards from `start` until
the last value less than `end`. If step is negative, then outputs values
incrementing downwards from `start` until the last value greater than `end`.

A `start` greater than or equal to `end` for positive `step`, or a `start` less
than or equal to `end` for a negative `step`, is permitted, and produces an
empty iterator.

Throws an error if `step` is zero.

Example:

```ts
chainFrom(rangeIterator(3))
    .map(i => "String #" + i)
    .toArray(); // -> ["String #0", "String #1", "String#2"]

chainFrom(rangeIterator(10, 15)).toArray(); // -> [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

chainFrom(rangeIterator(10, 15, 2)).toArray(); // -> [10, 12, 14]

chainFrom(rangeIterator(15, 10, -2)).toArray(); // -> [15, 13, 11]
```

The iterator is lazy, so for example the following will return quickly and not
use up all your memory:

```ts
chainFrom(rangeIterator(1000000000000))
    .take(3)
    .toArray(); // -> [0, 1, 2]
```

### `reduced(result)`

Returns a reduced value of `result`, as described by the [transducer
protocol](https://github.com/cognitect-labs/transducers-js#reduced). Can be
returned by a reducer or a transformer to short-circuit computation.

## Tree-shakeable API

As discussed in the README section "Bundle Size and Tree-Shaking," Transducist
also provides standalone functions with the same behavior as the chain, for the
purposes of reducing bundle size. In particular, all chain methods (except
`toIterator()`) have a standalone function of the same name.

For those familiar with the [transducer
protocol](https://github.com/cognitect-labs/transducers-js#transformer-protocol),
the standalone functions corresponding to the transform methods (e.g. `map()`,
`take()`) each produce a transducer, while the standalone functions
corresponding to the end of the chain (e.g. `toArray()`, `count()`) each produce
a transformer.

In addition to the standalone functions whose names match the methods listed above, the tree-shakeable API is completed by the functions below.

### `compose(f1, f2, ...)`

Composes any number of transducers together to produce a new transducer. This is
actually just ordinary function composition, although its TypeScript typings are
for transducers in particular.

### `transduce(collection, transducer, transformer)`

(Or: `transduce(collection, transducer, reducer, initialValue)`)

Starting from the collection, applies the transformations specified by the transducer and then uses the transformer to construct a final result.

Rather than providing a transformer as the third argument, this may also be
called by passing an ordinary reducer function and an initial value as the final
two arguments, where a reducer is a plain function of the form `(acc, x) => acc`.

Example:

```ts
import { filter, map, toArray, transduce } from "transducist";

transduce(
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    compose(
        filter(x => x > 2),
        map(x => 2 * x),
    ),
    toArray(),
); // -> [6, 8, 10]
```

which is equivalent to the chained version:

```ts
import { chainFrom } from "transducist";

chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .filter(x => x > 2)
    .map(x => 2 * x)
    .toArray(); // -> [6, 8, 10]
```

### `lazyTransduce(collection, transducer)`

Returns an iterator which lazily performs the transformations specified by the
transducer. This is the standalone version of ending a chain with
[`.toIterator()`](#toiterator). That is, the following are equivalent:

```ts
import { filter, map, lazyTransduce } from "transducist";

lazyTransduce(
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    compose(
        filter(x => x > 2),
        map(x => 2 * x),
    ),
);
```
```ts
import { chainFrom } from "transducist";

chainFrom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    .filter(x => x > 2)
    .map(x => 2 * x)
    .toIterator();
```
